## Problem statement

### Triangle challenge (TS UI)

Write a program that will determine the type of a triangle. It should take the lengths of the triangle's three sides as input, and return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.

We are looking for solutions that showcase problem solving skills and structural considerations that can be applied to larger and potentially more complex problem domains. Pay special attention to tests, readability of code and error cases.

It would be great if you build the UI with our components: 
http://ui.tradeshift.com/ & https://github.com/Tradeshift/tradeshift-ui

The way you reflect upon your decisions is important to us, why we ask you to include a brief discussion of your design decisions and implementation choices.

The resulting code and discussion is vital for us and will be used as a way for us to validate your engineering skills. After having reviewed your code, weâ€™ll decide on next step.

Please put the solution up on GitHub and send the link to me. If you have some other code that you are proud of then please send that too.

## Thought process:

### Consuming components

Looking around the tradeshift UI repo, there is no immediate way of consuming the components.
First, I'll try to fork the repository to use the code and styles provided.

Then, exploring the gh-pages branch, if that might be easier to consume the components from. Components seem pretty integrated.

Found resources available at:
```html
  <script src="//d5wfroyti11sa.cloudfront.net/prod/client/ts-11.0.0-beta.11.min.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="//d5wfroyti11sa.cloudfront.net/prod/client/ts-11.0.0-beta.11.min.css"/>
```

Library is now available, but components don't display/behave correctly.
It seems like they need jquery? Adding that did not change anything.

Dialog seems to work! But Note doesn't. Icons work. Footer doesn't. Input autocomplete works.
Discovering that there is some page context (classes and elements, etc.) which certain components behave around.
Moving on to not spend too much time on this, since I might not need these types of components.

The core problem can be solved using just these components and plain old JavaScript, so I will refrain from adding a framework to the solution.

### Setting up a project structure

Setting up a simple webpack build seems to be the easiest approach (considering this project might grow).

On initial setup, when the page is resized I see the following error:
`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'tabs' of null ts-11.0.0-beta.11.js:47459`

I am expecting this to be due to the library expecting a certain context? I can't really find any documentation or bug reports on this.

### Core problem

Given lengths x,y,z
 // Inital naiive approach
 // check all lengths against each other
 // worst-case runtime O(n^2), though we are talking n=3

 // map = new Map()
 // for each l in lengths
 //   if (!map[l]) {
 //     map[l] = 0
 //   }
 //   map[l]++
 // result = 0
 // for each t in map
 //   if t > result
 //     result = t
 // return result;
 // worst-case runtime O(n)

 case: 0 equal lengths => scalene
 case: 2 equal lengths => isosceles
 case: 3 equal lengths => equilateral

 edge-cases:
 - Can the lengths form a triangle?
  - Triangle Inequality Theorem: This theorem simply states that the sum of two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.
 - Does the input hold more or less than three lengths?
 - 

### Presenting the problem for the user

A simple presentation would be to display three inputs to type in numbers and then provide the result on submit.

Something more involved could be a file-upload function (e.g. csv) or drawing feature, where the user can select three points and it will tell the result.
